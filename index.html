            <h2>Predicting Phone Price Range Using KNN Classifier</h2>
            <p>This project looks at the specifications and features of various mobile phones, aimed at exploring the relationships between different attributes and the overall pricing category of each phone. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify mobile phones into price ranges based on their specifications. This kind of analysis is particularly useful for companies in the mobile industry to strategically price their products and for consumers to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.</p>
