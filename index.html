                        <p class="full-description" style="display:none;">Passenger satisfaction is a crucial metric in the highly competitive airline industry. This study investigates the factors that most significantly influence passenger satisfaction, encompassing demographic details, flight characteristics, and service quality evaluations. The analysis leverages advanced techniques such as model interpretability and counterfactual analysis to dissect how various service attributes affect passenger satisfaction. The findings underscore the critical role of high-quality inflight services, including WiFi, seat comfort, and entertainment, in driving positive passenger experiences. Additionally, operational efficiencies, such as streamlined boarding processes and minimizing delays, are pivotal in maintaining high satisfaction levels. The importance of customer loyalty is also highlighted, with data showing that loyal passengers typically report higher satisfaction levels. Counterfactual simulations suggest that targeted improvements in service aspects like WiFi quality, seating comfort, and boarding efficiency could lead to substantial enhancements in overall satisfaction. Key recommendations derived from the analysis include upgrading inflight amenities, optimizing boarding and check-in processes, enhancing seat comfort, and reinforcing loyalty programs. Focusing on these areas can enable airlines to better meet passenger expectations, enhance loyalty, and strengthen their competitive positioning in the market. Furthermore, recommendations for marketing strategies and airline operations based on the findings will help airlines to enhance the overall travel experience and achieve greater customer satisfaction.</p>

                        <p class="full-description" style="display:none;">This project looks at the specifications and features of various mobile phones, aimed at exploring the relationships between different attributes and the overall pricing category of each phone. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify mobile phones into price ranges based on their specifications. This kind of analysis is particularly useful for companies in the mobile industry to strategically price their products and for consumers to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.</p>
